# MetaDataGeneratorNC – FAIR RDM Metadata Templates for Nextcloud

This repository is a template for a Nextcloud app called **MetaDataGeneratorNC** that enables users to create, manage, and apply standardized metadata templates directly within Nextcloud. By using this app, you can generate metadata templates and attach metadata (in the form of XML files) to your project or data folders. This approach transforms Nextcloud into a FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) research data management platform, contributing to the research data lifecycle and enhancing data reuse.

## Overview

### Why FAIR Metadata?
- **Controlled Vocabulary:**  
  Standardized metadata with controlled vocabulary ensures that research datasets are **Findable, Accessible, Interoperable,** and **Reusable**.
- **Accelerated Research Data Lifecycle:**  
  Integrating metadata templates into your Nextcloud environment accelerates the process from data creation and curation to sharing and reuse.
- **Seamless Data Reuse:**  
  Consistent metadata facilitates smooth data integration across projects, consortia, and platforms, enhancing the overall usability and value of research data.

### What MetaDataGeneratorNC Provides
- **Metadata Template Creation:**  
  Create and customize metadata templates using controlled vocabularies directly within Nextcloud.
- **Metadata Application:**  
  Apply existing metadata templates to your project or data folders and attach metadata as XML files.
- **Enhanced FAIR RDM:**  
  Ensures that all datasets are consistently annotated, making Nextcloud a robust platform for FAIR research data management.
