# MetaDataGeneratorNC – FAIR RDM Metadata Templates for Nextcloud (under construction)

This repository is a template for a Nextcloud app called **MetaDataGeneratorNC** that enables users to create, manage, and apply standardized metadata templates directly within Nextcloud. By using this app, you can generate metadata templates and attach metadata (in the form of XML files) to your project or data folders. This approach transforms Nextcloud into a FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) research data management platform, contributing to the research data lifecycle and enhancing data reuse.

## Overview

### Why FAIR Metadata?
- **Controlled Vocabulary:**  
  Standardized metadata with controlled vocabularies ensures that research datasets are easily searchable and interoperable.
- **Accelerated Research Data Lifecycle:**  
  By integrating metadata templates into your Nextcloud environment, the process from data creation to curation, sharing, and reuse is streamlined.
- **Seamless Data Reuse:**  
  Consistent metadata allows for smooth integration across projects and consortia, ultimately increasing the value and usability of research data.

### What MetaDataGeneratorNC Provides
- **Metadata Template Creation:**  
  Create customized metadata templates using controlled vocabularies directly within Nextcloud.
- **Metadata Application:**  
  Apply existing metadata templates to your project or data folders, and attach the metadata as XML files.
- **Enhanced FAIR RDM:**  
  By standardizing metadata at the source, the app makes Nextcloud an effective platform for FAIR research data management, supporting better data curation, sharing, and reuse.
